# Ray-Tracing (2D)

## An experiemental project to try to perform raytracing in 2D from a single point.

This project uses python alongside pygame to simulate raytracing in 2D. Random barriers are generated each time you launch the program and a light source will emit from your mouse pointer and automatically extend till the nearest barrier.

To run the program simply enter ```python main.py``` in the Ray-Tracing directory.
