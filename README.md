# Ray-Tracing

## An experiemental project to perform raytracing in a 2-Dimensional space from a single point light source.

This project uses python alongside pygame to simulate raytracing in 2D. Random barriers are generated each time you launch the program and a light source will emit from your mouse pointer and automatically extend till the nearest barrier.

NumPy, PyGame and Python 3 are required to run this program.
Use ```python main.py``` in the project root directory.
